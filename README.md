#  Unity Junior Programmer Pathway Unit 2 - Basic Gameplay

### Summary
In this Unit, you will program a top-down game with the objective of throwing food to hungry animals - who are stampeding towards you - before they can run past you. In order to do this, you will become much more familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation. In completing this Unit, you will learn how to program a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.

### Optional Bonus Features
- [x] **Easy:** Vertical player movement
    - Allow the player to move forward and backwards within a certain range.
- [x] **Medium:** Aggressive animals
    - Have animals that also spawn from the left and right side of the screen. If one of them hits you, “Game Over” should be logged to the console.
- [x] **Hard:** Game user interface
    - At the start of the game, display in the console that the player’s Lives = 3 and Score = 0. If the player feeds an animal, increase and display the Score. If the player misses an animal or is hit by one, decrease and display the Lives. When the number of Lives reaches 0, log “Game Over” in the console.
- [x] **Expert:** Animal hunger bar
    - Display a “hunger bar” on top of each of the animals. Then, each time you feed one of them, the hunger bar fills up a little. Each animal should require different amounts of food to successfully “feed” them. They should only disappear after their hunger bars are full.
